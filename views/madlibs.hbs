<h3>
    Everyone knows George Washington invented the {{number}} - dollar bill because it was his {{body}} on it, but I bet you don't know anything else about the guy. He was born in (the) {{place}}, and when he was a kid, he chopped down his father's favorite tree with a/an {{noun}}. After that he became a/an {{occupation}} and fought against the French in Indian {{noun2}}. When he was done {{verbing}}, he married a/an {{noun3}} named Martha {{lastName}}. I guess she loved him, even though he had teeth made of {{plural}}. They lived on a farm called Mount {{lastName}} until George got tired of being a/an {{occupation}} and decided to help the United States win its {{noun4}} from England. Everyone thought George was so {{adj}}. When he died, George was buried inside a mountain called Mount Rushmore because it already had his {{body}} on it.
